**✨ Turn complex AI workflows into production-ready APIs in minutes!**  
This repository demonstrates how to combine CrewAI's powerful agent orchestration with FastAPI's high-performance framework to create enterprise-grade AI services.

## 🔥 Why You Should Care

✅ **Real-Time AI Teams** - Create dynamic agent teams (writers, translators, analysts) that collaborate through API endpoints  
✅ **Blazing Fast Inference** - Leverage Groq's LPU for 300x faster LLM responses compared to traditional GPUs  
✅ **Production-Ready** - JWT Auth, Rate Limiting, and Caching built-in  
✅ **Zero Vendor Lock-In** - Switch between AI models (Groq/OpenAI/Anthropic) with one config change  

## 🎯 Key Features

```python
# Your AI workforce on-demand
POST /api/v1/analyze
{
  "documentation": "Your technical content here",
  "target_language": "Spanish"
}

# Returns
{
  "summary": "Concise technical summary...",
  "translation": "Localized translation...",
  "quality_score": 92.4
}
```

## 🚄 Getting Started in 60 Seconds

### Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crewai-fastapi-service.git
